ABSTRACT = {Covert networks refer to criminal organizations that operate outside the boundaries of the law; they can be mainly classified as terrorist networks and criminal networks. We consider how Social Network Analysis (SNA) is used to analyze such networks in order to attain a greater knowledge of criminal behavior. In fact, SNA allows examining the network structure and functioning by computing relevant metrics and parameters to identify roles, positions, features, and other network functioning that are not otherwise easily discovered at first glance. This is why Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are showing growing interest in SNA, which is also used to identify weak spots and disrupt criminal groups. This paper provides a literature review and a classification of methods and real-case applications of disruption techniques. It considers covert network adaptability to such dismantling attempts, herein referred to as resilience. Critical problems of SNA in criminal studies are discussed, including data collection techniques and the inevitable incompleteness and biases of real-world datasets, with the aim of promoting a new research stream for both dismantling techniques and data collection issues.},

abstract = {The proper functioning of many sociotechnical systems depends on their level of connectivity. By removing or deactivating a specific set of nodes, a network structure can be dismantled into isolated subcomponents, thereby disrupting the malfunctioning of a system or containing the spread of misinformation or an epidemic. We propose a generalized network-dismantling framework, which can take realistic removal costs into account such as the node price, the protection level, or removal energy. We discuss applications of cost-efficient dismantling strategies to real-world problems such as containing an epidemic or dismantling criminal or corruption networks.Finding an optimal subset of nodes in a network that is able to efficiently disrupt the functioning of a corrupt or criminal organization or contain an epidemic or the spread of misinformation is a highly relevant problem of network science. In this paper, we address the generalized network-dismantling problem, which aims at finding a set of nodes whose removal from the network results in the fragmentation of the network into subcritical network components at minimal overall cost. Compared with previous formulations, we allow the costs of node removals to take arbitrary nonnegative real values, which may depend on topological properties such as node centrality or on nontopological features such as the price or protection level of a node. Interestingly, we show that nonunit costs imply a significantly different dismantling strategy. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a method which is based on the spectral properties of a node-weighted Laplacian operator and combine it with a fine-tuning mechanism related to the weighted vertex cover problem. The proposed method is applicable to large-scale networks with millions of nodes. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and opens more directions for understanding the vulnerability and robustness of complex systems.},

    abstract = { Centrality indices are an essential concept in network analysis. For those based on shortest-path distances the computation is at least quadratic in the number of nodes, since it usually involves solving the single-source shortest-paths (SSSP) problem from every node. Therefore, exact computation is infeasible for many large networks of interest today. Centrality scores can be estimated, however, from a limited number of SSSP computations. We present results from an experimental study of the quality of such estimates under various selection strategies for the source vertices. }
